# CCsSalon

## Description

- Team motivation was to re-create a deployed website that would set appointment for the hair stylist and Allow these users to signup and login/log out.
- This project was built with someone's sister in mind so her side business could grow with a webiste.
- This solves the issue of keeping a paper calendar and creating a digital one, lets customers pay a deposit for their appointment using Stripe and nodemailer to confirm appointment.
- Our group learned how to execute research with errors and how to communicate with each other on what was being/ or had been done to that our group could help each other out.
